# Key Features

- **Node-Based Graph Scheduling**: Nodos leverages a dynamic node-based graph structure, offering flexible and efficient scheduling for various tasks and processes.
- **C++ Development**: Nodes are developed using C++, ensuring high performance and robustness.
- **C API Support**: The system supports node creation via a C API, making it accessible to a broader range of developers.
- **Shader Language Integration**: Supports GLSL and HLSL shaders, with automatic compilation and runtime linking to shader parameters, eliminating the need for additional C++ code. Both fragment and computer shaders are supported.
- **Cross-Process**: Enables seamless execution of another process, linked with Nodos process within the node graph using the Nodos AppSDK.
- **AI Model Support with ONNX Runtime**: Run AI models in real-time using ONNX Runtime with CUDA and TensorRT, supporting image-to-image models including segmentation, super resolution, and depth generation.
